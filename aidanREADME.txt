On laptop I am using python that I installed locally NOT the windows store version (this is python v3.11.3)
On Desktop I am using python that I installed locally NOT the windows store version (this is python v3.11.2)
I used pip install for everything and conda is likely not installed.
heapq seems to be broken.
skipped because bad vibes and didn't work!
    conda install anaconda::pyqt
    conda install skimage

avast does weird shit on Desktop, im assuming it still works tho

Looks like github doesnt really work with juypiter notebooks
code should be written or copied into the .py file so that it can be sent around
