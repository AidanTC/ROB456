On laptop I am using python that I installed locally NOT the windows store version (this is python v3.11.3)
I used pip install for everything and conda is likely not installed.
heapq seems to be broken.
skipped because bad vibes and didn't work!
    conda install anaconda::pyqt
    conda install skimage
